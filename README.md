# Mooncloud Instant Messages Website
Current live demo (work in progress): https://mooncloud-services.up.railway.app

## Personal project
Written mainly in TypeScript, vanilla JavaScript and NodeJS as its (server) framework, with EJS template, CSS styling, Socket.io library for server-browser communications and MongoDB as database, is a project I’ve engaged to dive deeper into the JavaScript world. The reason for picking NodeJS instead of any other sophisticated JS-like framework is because I wanted to create a website app that’s written in vanilla JS / TS to understand it’s core functionality and workflow before getting my hands on other frameworks that wraps and covers all of the JS basics and functionalities underneath. As for the project’s theme, I was interested in how instant messaging (chatting) works and is transmitted, as well as adding / removing friends, getting notifications, user settings and other similar miscellaneous things similar to my previous PHP project.
